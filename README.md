## How to run locally

In the file Program.cs: you set policy.WithOrigins to where you host front-end; in this case, our front-end app is locally hosted on http://localhost:4200

In the file appsettings.json: you set DB to the connection string of your database, everyone will have a different connection string.
Ensure you create a database called LMS. In my case, see picture below:

In the file appsettings.json: you set FromEmail and EmailAccountPassword. FromEmail is your Email and follow this tutorial https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en for EmailAccountPassword

Running commands below for your database:

    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
    ### This command installs the Entity Framework Core (EF Core) Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool globally on your system.
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialDB
    ### This command creates a new migration named "InitialDB" based on the changes made to your DbContext.
    dotnet ef database update
    ### This command applies any pending migrations to the database, ensuring that the database schema matches the model defined in your DbContext.

## How to run an application from a deployed front-end

In the file Program.cs: you set policy.WithOrigins to where you host front-end
